We introduce
 Wan-Animate
, a unified framework for character animation and re-
placement.   Given  a  character  image  and  a  reference  video,
  Wan-Animate
  can
animate the character by precisely replicating the expressions and movements of
the character in the video to generate high-fidelity character videos. Alternatively,
it can integrate the animated character into the reference video to replace the orig-
inal character, replicating the scene’s lighting and color tone to achieve seamless
environmental integration.
 Wan-Animate
 is built upon the Wan model. To adapt it
for character animation tasks, we employ a modified input paradigm to differen-
tiate between reference conditions and regions for generation. This design unifies
multiple tasks into a common symbolic representation.  We use spatially-aligned
skeleton  signals  to  replicate  body  motion  and  implicit  facial  features  extracted
from  source  images  to  reenact  expressions,  enabling  the  generation  of  charac-
ter videos with high controllability and expressiveness.  Furthermore, to enhance
environmental integration during character replacement, we develop an auxiliary
Relighting LoRA. This module preserves the character’s appearance consistency
while applying the appropriate environmental lighting and color tone. Experimen-
tal results demonstrate that
 Wan-Animate
 achieves state-of-the-art performance.
We are committed to open-sourcing the model weights and its source code. Project

NTRODUCTION
Character  image  animation  is  a  significant  research  area  that  has  achieved  remarkable  progress,
driven by advancements in visual generative techniques,  particularly the application of diffusion
models.  This technology holds substantial potential value, with wide-ranging applications in film-
making, advertising, and the creation of digital avatars.  Previous works, such as Hu (2024); Zhu
et al. (2025); Tu et al. (2025), have thoroughly explored diffusion-based architectures for charac-
ter image animation, introducing significant enhancements in consistency and controllability.  Fur-
thermore, some studies Hu et al. (2025); Men et al. (2024); Xu et al. (2024c); Wang et al. (2025a)
have incorporated environmental information, extending the generative capabilities to more versatile
tasks like character replacement and human-object interaction synthesis.  More recently, following
the introduction of Sora Brooks et al. (2024) by OpenAI, video generation leveraging the Diffusion
Transformer Peebles & Xie (2023) architecture has undergone explosive development.  The emer-
gence of numerous open-source works Kong et al. (2025); Wan et al. (2025) has catalyzed parallel
advancements in related sub-tasks.  Consequently, DiT-based character image animation Gan et al.
(2025); Zhou et al. (2025); Luo et al. (2025) has also garnered considerable research interest.  By
capitalizing on the capabilities of pre-trained video foundation models,  the realism and temporal
coherence of the generated character videos have been substantially improved.
However, a critical gap remains: no existing framework provides a holistic solution for high-fidelity
character  animation  that  unifies  the  control  of  motion,  expression,  and  environment  interaction.
Within the open-source domain,  existing works on character image animation exhibit significant
shortcomings in both performance and completeness.  The majority of open-source contributions,
such as Zhu et al. (2025); Zhang et al. (2024); Tu et al. (2025); Wang et al. (2024), are designed
based on UNet-based foundation models (e.g., SD Rombach et al. (2022), SVD Blattmann et al.
(2023)), and their results lag considerably behind the current state-of-the-art. While some DiT-based
open-source projects Zhou et al. (2025); Wang et al. (2025b) focus on motion control, they fall short

Replacement
Figure 1:  Given a character image and a reference video,
  Wan-Animate
 supports two core func-
tionalities.  In the first, which we term ”Animation,” it reenacts the motion and expression of the
character in the reference video to animate the static source image. In the second, termed ”Replace-
ment,” it substitutes the character in the reference video with the source identity, ensuring seamless
integration with the environment.
in holistically replicating expressive facial dynamics in conjunction with body movements.   Fur-
thermore, there is a scarcity of dedicated open-source methods for integrating character animation
with environmental contexts (i.e., character replacement). Although some video generation methods
Jiang et al. (2025) can approximate this functionality, they typically suffer from issues with consis-
tency and usability.  These unresolved challenges collectively hinder the continuous development
and innovation of character image animation within the open-source community.
To  address  the  aforementioned  issues,  this  report  introduces  a  unified  framework  for  Character
Animation and Replacement, termed
 Wan-Animate
, which achieves holistic replication with high-
fidelity results. As illustrate in Figure 1, given a character image and a reference video,
 Wan-Animate
can accurately replicate the facial expressions and body movements from the reference to animate
the character, generating a realistic character video. Concurrently,
 Wan-Animate
 supports character
replacement, enabling the animated character to be integrated into the reference video to replace
the original character.  This process also replicates the video’s lighting and color tone, achieving a
seamless fusion of the character and the environment.
Methodologically,
 Wan-Animate
 is built upon the Wan-I2V model as its foundation and is enhanced
through post-training with additional control conditions. Compared to Wan-I2V,
 Wan-Animate
 fea-
tures a modified input definition tailored for the demands of character animation.   We employ a
modified input paradigm to differentiate between reference conditions and regions designated for
generation, which in turn guides the injection of corresponding latents. This design unifies reference
image injection, temporal frame guidance, and the mode selection between full-frame generation and
character replacement into a common symbolic representation.  Crucially, this approach preserves
the original input structure of Wan-I2V, thereby minimizing distributional shift during post-training.
To achieve holistic character control, we decouple the control signals into body motion and facial
expressions.  For body motion, we adopt a skeleton-based representation to balance accuracy and
generality. As this signal is spatially aligned, it is injected by being added to the initial noise latents.
For expression replication, we directly use the original face images from the reference video as the
driving signal to preserve maximum detail.  These face images are encoded into latent vectors to
disentangle expression information from identity attributes. These latents are then temporally com-
pressed to align with the video latents and are injected into the model via cross-attention. This joint
control strategy demonstrates high robustness and precision.  When performing character replace-
ment, we develop an auxiliary Relighting LoRA to enhance the consistency between character and
2

environment.  After the base model ensures the consistent transfer of the character’s appearance,
this module applies appropriate environmental lighting and color tones, resulting in a more seamless
integration of the replaced character into the video.
We are committed to releasing the entire
 Wan-Animate
 framework to the public, encompassing the
model weights and the complete pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that
 Wan-Animate
 pos-
sesses excellent and versatile capabilities.  It not only animates characters to generate expressive
videos but also generalizes well to a wide range of humanoid characters, demonstrating strong ro-
bustness across various scenarios such as portraits,  half-body,  and full-body shots.  Furthermore,
it exhibits a competitive advantage in quality even when compared to several closed-source com-
mercial products.  We hope that the release of
 Wan-Animate
 will make a significant contribution to
accelerating the development of character image animation. We also aim to empower developers of
all levels with access to a high-caliber model, enabling them to build diverse applications, inspire
novel product paradigms, and ultimately facilitate the technology’s real-world deployment.

Character Image Animation.
    Earlier works in image animation primarily focused on warping-
based feature representations and GAN-based architectures Siarohin et al. (2019); Zhao & Zhang
(2022); Siarohin et al. (2021).  In contrast, recent approaches Hu (2024); Xu et al. (2024b); Chang
et al. (2023); Zhu et al. (2025); Tu et al. (2025) have shifted to designing architectures based on
diffusion models Ho et al. (2020), which has led to significant improvements in performance.  For
instance, Animate Anyone Hu (2024) utilizes a ReferenceNet structure to inject the character’s ap-
pearance features, achieving excellent results in consistency preservation.  For temporal modeling,
it employs temporal layers inspired by AnimateDiff Guo et al. (2023), which are embedded within
the Stable Diffusion Rombach et al. (2022) architecture.  This design paradigm has been adopted
by many subsequent methods Zhu et al. (2025); Tu et al. (2025).  However, as a foundation model
primarily for image generation, Stable Diffusion lacks inherent temporal knowledge.  To address
this limitation, some works Wang et al. (2024); Zhang et al. (2024) have started building upon video
foundation models.  Since these models already possess knowledge of inter-frame consistency and
continuity from their pre-training, the resulting image animation architectures can be more stream-
lined.  More recently, with the dramatic improvement in video generation capabilities brought by
DiT-based models Kong et al. (2025); Wan et al. (2025); Yang et al. (2024),  their application to
image animation Zhou et al. (2025); Luo et al. (2025) has led to substantial enhancements in the
realism and temporal continuity of generated characters. Correspondingly, our
 Wan-Animate
 is also
built upon the open-source model Wan2.1, fully leveraging its robust pre-trained knowledge to en-
sure high-quality visual generation from the outset.
Beyond the generation of the character itself, some works also investigate the fusion of the animated
character with its surrounding environment or with objects it interacts with. For instance, Men et al.
(2024) takes an additional background image as input,  enabling the generated character video to
feature a specified scene. Another approach, proposed by Hu et al. (2025), utilizes a masking mech-
anism to differentiate between the background environment and interactive objects, which results in
generated characters that are highly compatible with the environment. Conceptually, these methods
can be adapted for the task of video character replacement.  Furthermore, a related line of research
focuses on generating videos of human-object interactions Xu et al. (2024c); Wang et al. (2025a).
These methods aim to generate not only a moving character but also a co-moving object that is
animated in a physically consistent and synchronized manner.
Facial Animation.
  The field of facial animation Wang et al. (2022); Guo et al. (2024) has also ben-
efited significantly from the application of diffusion models, achieving remarkable advancements.
Drawing inspiration from pose-guided human animation, some early works Wei et al. (2024); Ma
et al. (2024); Zhang et al. (2024); Tu et al. (2025) employed facial landmarks as control signals
to  generate  expressions,  with  their  architectural  designs  closely  following  the  human  animation
paradigm. However, compared to body poses, facial landmarks can lose fine-grained details during
extraction, which compromises the expressiveness of the resulting animations and makes it diffi-
cult to synthesize subtle expressions. Moreover, in cross-identity application scenarios, dense facial
landmarks demand high precision in signal retargeting, posing a significant challenge when driving
diverse character identities. More recently, some methods Xu et al. (2024a); Drobyshev et al. (2024);

, which is built upon Wan-I2V. We modify its input formula-
tion to unify reference image input, temporal frame guidance, and environmental information (for
dual-mode compatibility) under a common symbolic representation.  For body motion control, we
use skeleton signals that are merged via spatial alignment.  For facial expression control, we lever-
age implicit features extracted from face images as the driving signal.  Additionally, for character
replacement, we train an auxiliary Relighting LoRA to enhance the character’s integration with the
new environment.
Ki et al. (2024); Xie et al. (2024); Zhao et al. (2025); Xu et al. (2025); Luo et al. (2025) have begun
to move away from manually defined motion signals, instead using the raw source images to extract
implicit representations as control inputs. This approach has led to substantial improvements in both
expressiveness and generality.
Video Generation.
  Since the release of Sora Brooks et al. (2024) by OpenAI, DiT-based Peebles &
Xie (2023) approaches have gradually supplanted UNet-based ones, becoming the mainstream tech-
nical route in video generation research.  The adoption of a pure Transformer architecture allows
model parameters to be scaled up significantly.  Coupled with the expansion of training data, this
has resulted in a qualitative leap in video generation quality.  To fuse multi-modal features within
a Transformer,  videos are tokenized into discrete sequences.   Specifically,  a 3D VAE Kingma &
Welling (2014) is first used to compress the video in both spatial and temporal dimensions, drasti-
cally reducing feature length. The compressed representation is then discretized through a patchify-
ing process. Most recent DiT-based video generation models Kong et al. (2025); Wan et al. (2025);
Yang et al. (2024) follow this pipeline. As the technology has matured, a growing number of foun-
dation models for video generation have been open-sourced, with HunyuanVideo and Wan being
particularly representative works.  These have spurred a surge of follow-up research and applica-
tions in video generation.  Consequently, the field of character image animation has also benefited
from the advancements in video foundation models, with its performance gradually aligning with
the capabilities of general video generation.

EFINITION
Wan-Animate
 features two core functionalities:  Animation Mode and Replacement Mode.  In Ani-
mation Mode, the character from a source image is animated according to the motion of the character
in a reference video, while the background from the source image is preserved. This process is anal-
ogous to an Image-to-Video (I2V) synthesis task.  In Replacement Mode,  the character from the
source image is driven by the same reference motion but is then integrated into the environment of
the reference video. This effectively replaces the original subject, a task that corresponds to Video-
to-Video (V2V) translation.   The common objective of both modes is to accurately replicate the
motion and facial expressions from the reference character.  The key distinction lies in the source
of the final video’s background:  in Animation Mode, it is derived from the source image, whereas
in Replacement Mode, it is inherited from the reference video.
  Wan-Animate
 unifies both modes
within a single, jointly trained model, with the exception of the Relighting LoRA which is specific
to the Replacement Mode. By making minor adjustments to the input format, the model can generate
outputs in the desired mode. The overall architecture is shown in Figure 2.

ORMULATION
Wan-Animate
 leverages Wan-I2V as its foundational architecture. The input to Wan-I2V consists of
three components:  noise latent, conditional latent, and binary mask.  Since the I2V task is defined
as generating a video from a given image as the first frame, the conditional latent is constructed by
concatenating the given image with zero-filled frames along the temporal dimension.  The binary
mask, which shares the same spatial and temporal dimensions as the conditional latent, uses a value
of 1 to denote preserved frames and 0 for frames to be generated.  For I2V, only the mask for the
first frame is set to 1.  However, character image animation imposes different requirements on the
input paradigm. Firstly, unlike the I2V setup where the image serves as the starting frame, our task
requires a character image to act as a consistent appearance reference. The content of the generated
video is dictated by driving signals, not initiated from the character image itself. Secondly, to enable
animation of arbitrary length, the generation of subsequent segments must be conditioned on the
final frame(s) of the preceding segment.  This provides temporal guidance and ensures continuity,
facilitating the synthesis of long videos.  Third, we aim to unify the Animation Mode and Replace-
ment Mode into a single model through a compatible representation, thereby reducing redundant
training efforts. Therefore, to accommodate these unique demands,
 Wan-Animate
 introduces a mod-
ified input paradigm based on the original Wan-I2V formulation.
Reference Formulation.

Given a reference character image, we first encode it into a dedicated
reference latent using the Wan-VAE. To fully leverage the inter-frame consistency capabilities pre-
trained in the Wan model, the reference latent is concatenated with the conditional latents along the
temporal dimension (with the binary mask set to 1). This concatenation serves as the primary mech-
anism for injecting the character’s appearance. To accommodate the temporal guidance required for
long video synthesis, we randomly select the first few latents from the target sequence to serve as
temporal latents. For these selected latents, their corresponding ground-truth values are used as the
condition latents, and the associated binary mask is set to 1 across the entire frame.  This enables
the model to generate temporally coherent videos guided by these temporal frames.  We employ a
probabilistic training strategy where temporal latents are used only with a certain probability.  This
approach ensures the model learns to balance its generative capabilities across different conditional
inputs.  Notably,  the denoising process generates a complete output sequence,  including the por-
tions for the references.  The resulting frames that correspond to these references are subsequently
discarded.
Environment Formulation.

In Animation Mode,  the conditional frames corresponding to the
target frames are zero-filled, and their associated binary mask is set entirely to 0. Consequently,
 Wan-
Animate
 generates the character video while preserving the background from the given reference
image,  a process analogous to the standard I2V mode.   In Replacement Mode,  we first segment
the character from the reference video.   Following the mask formulation strategy from Hu et al.
(2025), we then generate environment images by zeroing out the segmented subject region.  This
environment  image  serves  as  the  content  for  the  condition  frames.   Correspondingly,  the  binary
mask is set to 1 for the environment regions and 0 for the subject region. As a result,
 Wan-Animate
only generates content within the mask-zeroed areas, thereby preserving the original background of
the reference video.
In summary, the input paradigm of
 Wan-Animate
, while adapted for new tasks, fundamentally in-
herits the core philosophy of Wan-I2V. This design elegantly accommodates the diverse conditional
requirements of character animation and supports dual generative modes.  This adaptability allows
the model to be fine-tuned rapidly and effectively during post-training, leading to strong empirical
results.

Body Control.
    Prior research has demonstrated the effectiveness of spatially-aligned signals for
guiding human video generation.  In terms of current technical approaches, there are two primary
types  of  body  control  signals:  2D  skeleton-based  representations  and  rendered  images  from  3D
SMPL Loper et al. (2023).  The skeleton-based approach offers better generality, particularly for
non-humanoid characters with unconventional shapes, demonstrating greater robustness.  However,
it faces challenges in representing complex motions due to spatial ambiguity and is susceptible to
issues like missing or erroneous keypoints.  Conversely,  SMPL, as a 3D signal,  provides a more

ates within each corresponding temporal segment.
accurate representation of inter-limb relationships in complex poses but may lack precision for ex-
tremity positions and has poor capture capability for non-human characters. Additionally, rendered
SMPL images contain the character’s shape information.  This can cause the model to rely on the
shape  cues  embedded  within  the  motion  signal,  which  complicates  the  learning  of  identity  con-
sistency, especially if the SMPL shape is not accurate.  After careful consideration, we adopt the
skeleton-based representation for body control, as it better caters to the majority of mainstream use
cases.  In our implementation, the skeleton for the character in the target frames is extracted using
VitPose Xu et al. (2022) to generate pose frames. In our design of Body Adapter, these pose frames
are compressed by Wan-VAE to align spatially and temporally with the target latents.   We use a
projection layer to patchify the pose latents and add them to the patchified noise latents.  Crucially,
the reference latent is not injected with pose information.  This design choice serves to temporally
differentiate the reference latent from the target latents.
Face Control.
   A straightforward approach would be to use facial landmarks as a spatially-aligned
signal for driving facial animation, similar to body control.  However, this method suffers from a
loss of fine-grained detail during landmark extraction, making it difficult to fully replicate the ex-
pressiveness of the character from the reference video. Moreover, as dense signals, facial landmarks
demand high precision; otherwise, they can severely compromise identity consistency, especially in
cross-identity scenarios involving significant facial shape disparities.  In contrast, we avoid manu-
ally defined facial signals and instead use the raw facial image directly as the driving input. During
training, we leverage the character’s skeletal information to locate and crop the facial region from
the driving image.  Since our training is self-supervised, it is crucial to disentangle identity infor-
mation from expression information when extracting facial features.  This prevents the model from
using identity cues to guide generation, which could lead to identity leakage.  We employ two pri-
mary strategies to address this challenge: 1) We spatially compress the facial image into a 1D latent,
which reduces the storage of low-level, identity-specific information.  2) During training, we ap-
ply a suite of data augmentations to the facial image, including scaling, color jittering, and random
noise.   This introduces deliberate discrepancies between the augmented face and the target face,
discouraging the model from overfitting to identity features.
Architecturally,  in  Face  Adapter,  we  adopt  an  encoder  structure  identical  to  that  of  Wang  et  al.
(2022) to extract features from each face image.  We also employ Linear Motion Decomposition to
orthogonalize these features, which facilitates a better disentanglement of expression information.
Input face images are resized to
 512
×
 512
, and each frame is compressed into a latent vector.  As
shown in Figure 3, we use a stack of 1D causal convolutional layers to temporally downsample the
face latents, aligning their sequence length with that of the noise latents.  The aligned face latents
are then injected into dedicated ”Face Blocks” within the Transformer.  Feature fusion is achieved
via a temporally-aligned cross-attention mechanism, where the attention computation is confined to
the corresponding set of tokens at each timestep. To reduce the computational load, we opt to inject
face information only into specific layers of the DiT network. Empirically, we perform this injection
every 5 layers in the 40-layer Wan-14B model, resulting in a total of 8 injection layers.

Preserving the character’s appearance is a crucial feature in character image animation.  However,
when performing character replacement, a challenge arises because the character and the environ-
ment originate from different sources.  Strictly maintaining appearance consistency can lead to a
mismatch between the animated character’s lighting and color tone and those of the new environ-
ment,  which compromises the realism of the final result.  Therefore,  for Replacement Mode,  we
introduce an auxiliary Relighting LoRA Hu et al. (2022).  This module allows for further adjust-
ments to the character’s lighting and color tone during replacement, enabling it to adapt to the new
environment.  The Relighting LoRA is applied exclusively to the self-attention and cross-attention
layers within the DiT blocks.  To train this LoRA, we construct specific data pairs.  For a reference
image sampled from a video clip, we first segment and crop the character from the original image.
We then use IC-Light Zhang et al. (2025) to synthesize the character onto a new,  random back-
ground.  As illustrated in Figure 4, leveraging IC-Light’s capabilities, the character’s lighting and
color tone are influenced by the new background, creating a discrepancy with the original video se-
quence. This newly synthesized image is then used as the reference, allowing the Relighting LoRA
to learn the ability to perform lighting and color adjustments.  When augmented with the Relight-
ing LoRA,
 Wan-Animate
 can produce a better environmental fusion for the replaced character while
simultaneously preserving its identity.

RAINING
The training process of
 Wan-Animate
 is divided into the following stages:
Body Control Training.
   We first focus exclusively on training the model for Animation Mode. In
this stage, conditioning is limited to the body control signal, with no facial signal injection. The goal
is for the model to quickly learn our modified input paradigm (i.e., the specific configurations for
the reference image and temporal images) and to master the alignment with the body control signal.
Face Control Training.

Next,  we introduce  facial signal injection.   Building  upon the  model
from Stage 1, we integrate the Face Adapter and Face Block modules.  To accelerate training, we
initialize a portion of their parameters using the pre-trained encoder weights from Wang et al. (2022).
This stage primarily utilizes portrait data, as facial motion is the dominant dynamic in such videos,
allowing for a focused learning of expression-driven animation.  We also use facial landmarks to
identify head, eye, and mouth regions, applying a higher loss weight to these areas to enhance their
fidelity.
Joint Control Training.
   Here, we combine the Face Adapter and Face Block modules from Stage
2 with the main model trained in Stage 1,  and perform joint control training on the full dataset.
Our experiments show that the standalone face module already possesses strong expression-driving
capabilities, enabling the full model to converge rapidly.
Joint Mode Training.

In this stage, we adapt the training data to include formats for both An-
imation Mode and Replacement Mode.  Given the model’s established animation capabilities and
the compatibility of our input formulation with Wan-I2V’s pre-training, this transition is remarkably
smooth.
Relighting LoRA Training.
  Finally, we exclusively train the relighting capability for the Replace-
ment Mode by applying the Relighting LoRA. The detailed methodology for this stage is described
in Section 3.4.

Pose Retargeting.

During inference,  the characters in the provided image and reference video
often have different identities.  Due to disparities in bone proportions and relative size, for Anima-
tion Mode, we perform pose retargeting on the skeletons extracted from the reference video.  This
involves calculating the length ratio of each corresponding limb between the two characters and
adjusting the target pose’s bone lengths to match the character in the source image.  Additionally,
the pose is translated to align with the character’s position in the image.  The reference point for
this translation is determined by the framing of the shot (e.g., feet for full-body and neck for half-
body or portraits).  We will open-source a simplified version our retargeting pipeline.  Since we use
a 2D skeleton, the character’s posture can affect the accuracy of the calculated bone lengths.  To
mitigate this, we provide an auxiliary solution.  Specifically, we use the image editing model Wu
et al. (2025); Labs et al. (2025) to edit the characters in both the reference and driving images into a
standard T-pose. The scaling factors are then calculated based on the bone lengths from these edited
T-pose images. In most scenarios, this approach leads to more accurate retargeting. In Replacement
Mode, given that the character may have specific interactions with the environment, we aim to avoid
disrupting these relationships. Therefore, we do not recommend using pose retargeting during char-
acter replacement.  This, however, introduces a limitation for certain use cases, such as replacing
characters with significant body shape differences, which may result in some deformation.
Long Video.
    For long video generation, we adopt an iterative generation approach.  Specifically,
for the first segment, we concatenate only the reference latent and the noise latents. After generating
the video result for this segment, we select its last few frames to serve as the temporal guidance for
the subsequent segment.  The generation of all subsequent segments then involves a concatenation
of the reference latent, the temporal latents, and the new noise latents. Based on practical usage, we
typically use one or two latents as temporal guidance, corresponding to 1 or 5 frames, respectively.
After the denoising process is complete for each segment, we discard the portions corresponding
to the reference latent and the temporal guidance latents.  The remaining generated content is then
concatenated to form the final long video.

We collected a large dataset of human-centric videos, covering activities such as speaking, facial

(2023); Schuhmann (2022) similar to those required for general video generation.  To ensure iden-
tity consistency during training, we verified that each video clip features only a single, consistent
character. We extracted skeleton information for each character, which serves a dual purpose: first,
as the motion signal annotation, and second, as a criterion for filtering videos based on character
behavior.  For the character replacement task, we use the annotated skeletons to track the character
and then extract the corresponding character masks using SAM2 Ravi et al. (2024).  Additionally,
we used the QwenVL2.5-72B Bai et al. (2025) model to generate textual descriptions for each video
to support the post-training requirements of Wan.  While
 Wan-Animate
 supports a degree of textual
control, the motion signal is the dominant control factor, making text control a non-core feature. In
practice, we recommend using a default text prompt.

Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP) Zhao et al. (2023) to reduce the per-GPU memory footprint. The
remaining models are trained using standard Data Parallelism (DP). For the DiT model specifically,
we also utilize a Context Parallelism scheme, which combines RingAttention and Ulysses Fang &
Zhao (2024) to enable parallel training.  This approach further reduces memory consumption and
accelerates training speed. For the frame-wise facial feature extraction within the Face Adapter, we
parallelize the computation within each Ulysses group by treating the facial frames from a single
video clip as a batch and processing them concurrently.

Wan-Animate
  supports  arbitrary  output  resolutions.   In  Animation  Mode,  the  output  aspect  ratio
conforms to that of the input character image.  In Replacement Mode, it conforms to the reference
video’s  aspect  ratio.   The  final  inference  resolution  is  determined  based  on  the  total  number  of
video tokens after patchify. For example, we first calculate a target token count based on a standard
resolution like
 1280
×
 720
.  Then, for a given aspect ratio, we select the resolution that yields a
token count closest to this target.   Each inference segment consists of 78 frames.   One frame is
statically reserved for the character image. Of the remaining 77 frames, for any segment other than
the first, 1 or 5 frames are used as temporal reference frames, sourced from the end of the preceding
segment. To maintain high inference efficiency, classifier-free guidance (CFG) is disabled by default.
However, in scenarios where finer control over facial expression is desired, CFG can be optionally
enabled for the face conditioning input to adjust the reenactment effect.

VALUATION
We conducted a quantitative comparison with several mainstream open-source character animation
frameworks. To facilitate a more comprehensive evaluation, we established our own benchmark for
quantitative assessment.  The test dataset contains videos of human subjects in various scenarios,
featuring different character scales and actions. For the evaluation, we adopted a self-reconstruction
task:  the first frame of a video is used as the reference image, and the model then reconstructs the
video using motion signals from the subsequent frames.  We employed several widely-used quanti-
tative metrics, including SSIM Wang et al. (2004), LPIPS Zhang et al. (2018), and FVD Unterthiner
et al. (2018).  Additionally, we partitioned a subset containing only portraits from our test data to
conduct a separate quantitative comparison against specialized facial animation methods. The com-
parison results are presented in Table 6. Most of the existing open-source frameworks are built upon
earlier UNet-based foundation models, which results in certain shortcomings in generation quality,
particularly regarding human realism, local details, and temporal smoothness.  While recent open-
source works based on DiT have improved the performance baseline, they are often limited in their
comprehensiveness  (e.g.,  body-driven  models  lack  effective  expression  reenactment,  expression-
driven models do not include the body, and support for diverse character types and scales is lacking).
In comparison,
 Wan-Animate
 performs better than these current open-source works, standing as the
most comprehensive and highest-performing open-source model to date.

VALUATION
Currently,  the  solutions  that  most  closely  resemble
  Wan-Animate
  in  terms  of  both  functionality
and performance are primarily closed-source:  Runway’s Act-two Runway (2025) and Bytedance’s
DreamActor-M1 Luo et al. (2025).  Compared to existing open-source alternatives, these two pro-
prietary solutions represent the state-of-the-art in character animation in the industry.  We compare
Wan-Animate
 with these two methods to demonstrate its superiority. Since conventional quantitative
reconstruction metrics may not accurately reflect perceptual differences when the results are of high
quality, we employ a cross-ID animation setup and conduct a user study for this comparison.  Each
data pair in our evaluation set consists of a driving video and a different character image. After gen-
erating the results, we invited 20 participants for a subjective evaluation. Specifically, we presented

competing method) and asked participants to choose their preferred result.  Their preference was
based on a comprehensive consideration of video generation quality, overall identity consistency,
motion accuracy,  and expression accuracy.   The results of the user study are shown in Figure 5,
which clearly indicates that
 Wan-Animate
 achieved a superior outcome.  We believe that the open-
sourcing of
 Wan-Animate
 will raise the performance baseline for open-source models in this domain,
contributing to the application and long-term development of this technology.

VALUATION
In this section, we present a visual comparison of our results.
Animation Mode.

We compare
 Wan-Animate
 with Animate Anyone, VACE, Runway Act-two,
and Dreamactor-M1. As can be seen in Figure 6: due to the limitations of its base model, Animate
Anyone exhibits significantly lower generation quality. VACE, being a general-purpose controllable
video generation model, shows instability in character animation tasks.  Runway Act-two struggles
significantly  with  capturing  relatively  complex  motions.   DreamActor-M1  tends  to  have  slightly
lower quality in local details and overall image fidelity. In comparison,
 Wan-Animate
 demonstrates
a more comprehensive and stable performance overall.
Replacement Mode.

We compare
 Wan-Animate
 with Animate Anyone 2 and VACE. As shown
in Figure 7: Animate Anyone 2 also suffers from insufficient generation quality, again likely due to
its base model. VACE has issues with identity consistency. Furthermore, its general-purpose nature
makes it highly dependent on parameter tuning, resulting in a higher barrier to entry.  In contrast,
Wan-Animate
 is much more user-friendly and performs better in character replacement.

Ablation Study on Face Adapter Training.
   Our training scheme employs a progressive pipeline:
we first train for body control, then for facial expressions, and finally train them jointly. This process
involves specific data usage and training techniques at each stage. This scheme is highly beneficial
for the convergence of the face adapter. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct an ablation study.
The baseline for comparison involves training the entire control module jointly on all data from the
start. The results are shown in Figure 8. We observe that in the baseline experiment, the expression
driving  is  inaccurate,  and  the  model  struggles  to  converge  properly.   We  believe  this  is  because
body motion is more complex; learning to align the body first facilitates the subsequent learning of
expressions.  Furthermore, since the face generally occupies a small portion of the frame in typical
data,  training  the  expression  module  on  portrait  data,  where  the  face  is  prominent,  significantly
accelerates its convergence.
Effect of Relighting LoRA.
  In Replacement Mode, we train the Relighting LoRA on specifically
constructed data to achieve better integration of the character with the environment in terms of light-
ing and color tone. We conducted an ablation study to verify its effect. Figure 9 shows a comparison
of the results with and without the Relighting LoRA. As can be seen, without the LoRA, the charac-

ter’s lighting and color tone in the generated video maintain a strong consistency with the reference
image. However, this can appear incongruous when integrated into the new environment. Therefore,
the Relighting LoRA adds a degree of flexible adaptability on top of the strong consistency require-
ment of the character animation task. With the Relighting LoRA, the fusion of the character and the
environment becomes more realistic and harmonious.  Critically, this is achieved without breaking
the character’s perceptual identity.

ONCLUSION
This paper introduces
 Wan-Animate
, a state-of-the-art method for character animation and replace-
ment.
   Wan-Animate
  supports  two  core  functionalities:  Character  Animation:  Given  a  reference
video and a character image, it drives the character image with the motion from the video to gen-
erate a new animation.   Character Replacement:  Given a reference video and a character image,
it  replaces  the  character  in  the  video  with  the  new  one.   We  design  a  modified  input  paradigm
that unifies these diverse input forms,  making the training process more efficient.
   Wan-Animate
achieves precise reenactment of both facial expressions and body motions. For signal injection, we
disentangle motion and expression.  Motion signals are integrated with the input noise latents via
spatially-aligned fusion, while expression signals are injected via attention using implicit features
extracted from the facial image. Furthermore, for character replacement, we have designed an aux-
iliary LoRA module that enables the model to better achieve lighting and color tone consistency
between the character and the new environment. The performance of
 Wan-Animate
 surpasses that of
current open-source and closed-source algorithms. We will open-source
 Wan-Animate
 to contribute
to the further iteration and application of this technology.
